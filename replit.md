# Overview

This is a Flask-based webhook testing application that provides both a webhook endpoint and a web interface for testing webhook functionality. The application accepts HTTP POST requests with various content types (JSON, form data, and plain text) and provides a user-friendly interface to test these endpoints. It's designed as a development tool for testing and debugging webhook integrations.
